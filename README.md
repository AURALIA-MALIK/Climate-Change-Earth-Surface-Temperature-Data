Analyzing long-term climate trends involves extensive data cleaning and preparation, particularly with datasets like the one featured on Kaggle. Historical climate data presents various challenges, including changes in measurement methods over time and the relocation of weather stations. For instance, early data collection involved mercury thermometers, where variations in visit times could affect measurements. Furthermore, airport construction in the 1940s led to the relocation of many weather stations, while the transition to electronic thermometers in the 1980s introduced potential biases.

To address these complexities, several organizations compile climate data, with NOAA's MLOST, NASA's GISTEMP, and the UK's HadCrut being the most prominent. A newer compilation from Berkeley Earth, affiliated with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, offers a comprehensive dataset. The Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Study combines 1.6 billion temperature reports from 16 existing archives, facilitating detailed analysis, including by country.

Included in this dataset are various files, such as:

Global Land and Ocean-and-Land Temperatures (GlobalTemperatures.csv)
Global Average Land Temperature by Country (GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv)
Global Average Land Temperature by State (GlobalLandTemperaturesByState.csv)
Global Land Temperatures By Major City (GlobalLandTemperaturesByMajorCity.csv)
Global Land Temperatures By City (GlobalLandTemperaturesByCity.csv)
These files provide insights into temperature trends at different spatial scales, from global averages to specific countries, states, and cities. The data is sourced from Berkeley Earth's data page ,offering transparency and reproducibility through published source data and transformation codes. Additionally, Berkeley Earth employs methods that allow inclusion of weather observations from shorter time series, minimizing data loss.
